Next we now have some new accessories to use with the Nitto/Fredorch chuck.  Actually the chinese Fredorch suction cup mount did an excellent job on holding with some toys I have on even during rough use, but some people swear by tie-down platens so here ya go, in 70mm and 120mm.  I can tweak that for any size needed upon request
