Here's the first upgrade I designed- it's a Print-In-Place locking latch which makes it very easy to establish tension, and can easily get very tight.  You will need two M3 20mm socket cap screws, two M3 nuts, an M5 nut, and an M5 bolt of about 15mm.  I got the best results by using an M5 finger nut, 15mm shank, 36mm wide wings.  It removes the need for any tools, and you can de-tension it while done to prevent plastic creep if you've put a lot of force on it
Printed just fine on PLA with the rear end (with the M5 nut cavity) facing down.
