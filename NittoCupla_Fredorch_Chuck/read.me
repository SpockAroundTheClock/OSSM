Behold, the most overengineered fucktoy accessory ever: the PIP Nitto Cupla chuck.  It tightly holds the Fredorch extension rods, springs, and toys with no rocking around.  The metal-ended chuck had some slight capacity to rock at an angle.  This came out PERFECT.  It is really strong and stiff.  Printed in PLA at 80% infill on the chuck.  The nut can be printed with lesser infill but it's not going to save much filament.
There are 3 hinged petals and they're all Print In Place (one petal hidden in this screenshot to show internal hinge structure).  The geometry is the fullest shape that can hinge past each other as it fans open and closed.  But they only hinge out a few deg because they will always be confined by the clamp nut.  Popping the first two free was easy, the third is a trick because you don't want to pry against the other freed petals.   Drop the rear end on the rail and bend against that.  If it needs more PIP clearance, I can do that.  There is a quirk in that if you unscrew the nut way too far, the petals will by pressed by the reverse taper inside the nut and start tightening again.
Printed in PLA 80%, from the base up without support.  Brim would be a good idea
