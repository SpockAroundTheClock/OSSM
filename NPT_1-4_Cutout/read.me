I'd tried to print the Nitto end itself in a platen, but as expected it can break with enough abuse.  I resolved to use the commercial Nitto  fittings with 1/4" NPT in back and screw the steel into the print so it would be almost impossible to break.  They're cheap enough.  They do also make 3/8" and 1/2" NPT, and female end versions, but steel 1/4" NPT male into this NPT hole removed from 3D print seems to be ideal all around.  


I also drafted a negative object with good clearances built it.  Fusion 360 never actually figured out tapered holes.  You can align this with the surface of your design and subtract it,  leaving a pre-clearanced tapered hole.

You need these Nitto-Cupla PM20 fittings:
